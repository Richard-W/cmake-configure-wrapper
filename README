Usage:
	Just add this script to the source dir of your cmake-project.
	Now you can build and install your project similar to an autotools-project
	with the following commands:

	./configure
	make
	make install

	As of now the configure script only supports the following options:
	CC
	CXX
	--prefix
	--srcdir
	--build-type
